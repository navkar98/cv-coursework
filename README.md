	<h1> Computer Vision Coursework </h1>
    This is some of my work that I did in my computer vision course. The course was pretty good and we got to learn a lot about computer vision applications. One of which was object detection, we had a project for circle detection using hough transform. You can find the hough_transform_circle.py file for the code and you can run it in your system.
